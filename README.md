# tictactoe
This is a kata for the tic-tac-toe game, written in JAVA, using the builder pattern.

# What is this repository for?

The concept of the two-dimensional grid is no longer obvious. The grid transfers to a set of lines. The game has a winner if 
any line is filled with the moves of a player. A similar abstraction of a board has also been used for my chess project graph. 
To understand graph better the implementation of the tic-tac-toe grid is much simpler.

# How do I get set up?

There is no user interface - only the builder pattern. The tests are started on command line with 'mvn clean test'. And
functionlity should be seen within the test cases, esp. in the test class Evaluate.
